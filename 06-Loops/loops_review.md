Great job! In this lesson, we learned how to write cleaner code with loops. You now know:

Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.

How to write for loops with an iterator variable that increments or decrements

How to use a for loop to iterate through an array

A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop

while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions

Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.

do...while loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution

The break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block

The benefits of for...of.

Create a for...of loop from scratch.

Use a for...of loop to iterate over characters in strings and elements in arrays.

Use break and continue to control looping in a for...of loop.


There are other for type loops in JavaScript that exist for different purposes, such as for...in. 
Be careful to choose the correct type of loop for your situation. The next time you need to iterate through 
an array, string, or array-like object and don’t need to access the index, consider trying out for...of to 
keep your code succinct and readable.
